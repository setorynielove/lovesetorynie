  <h1>Why This Matters</h1>
  <h2>The Need for Equal Justice</h2>

  <p>
    Many communities in the Philippines suffer because justice is often available only to those  
    who can afford it. Poor and marginalized groups are left behind, facing injustice without  
    the resources to defend themselves in court. This deepens inequality and fuels mistrust in  
    the legal system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawyers and legal institutions are not just about courtsâ€”they are about protecting human  
    rights and ensuring fairness in daily life. When people lose faith in justice, society  
    suffers from corruption, abuse, and fear. It is crucial to bridge this gap by promoting  
    accessible and affordable legal aid.
  </p>
  <p>
    This advocacy addresses these issues by raising awareness and empowering citizens to  
    fight for their rights. Without justice, peace cannot exist. Without accountability,  
    inequality will always thrive.
