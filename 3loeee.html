      <h2>Legal Literacy Workshops</h2>
      <img src="wok.jfif" alt="workshop" class="content-img">
      <p>
        We run workshops in schools, barangays, and community centers that teach essential rights (labor, family, tenants' rights,
        how to file complaints, and where to go for help). Workshops are interactive and use local examples so attendees
        can immediately apply what they learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workshops are led by law students with supervision from volunteer lawyers. Each participant receives a simple
        pocket guide with key phone numbers and step-by-step actions for common problems.

      <h2>Free Legal Aid Clinics</h2>
      <img src="pl.jfif" alt="legal aid clinic" class="content-img">
      <p>
        Through partnerships with local legal clinics and volunteer lawyers, we host monthly legal-aid days where people
        can get intake, advice, and referrals. Cases that need representation are referred to pro bono lawyers or PAO as appropriate.
      </p>

      <h2>Anti-Corruption & Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        We run campaigns to increase transparency in local governance, promote citizen reporting of abuses,
        and support policy efforts to strengthen oversight mechanisms.
