    Lawyers play a crucial role in building fair and peaceful societies.  
    They ensure that justice is accessible to everyone, regardless of status.  
    This supports the United Nations’ SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.

  <h2 id="why">Why Lawyers Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Lawyers protect the rights of the marginalized and the poor.  
    They act as defenders of truth, fairness, and equality before the law.  
    Without them, corruption and injustice would often go unchallenged.

    In the Philippines, groups like PAO (Public Attorney’s Office) provide free legal aid.  
    Organizations like FLAG fight for human rights and defend victims of abuse.  
    These efforts show how lawyers turn principles into real change in society.
